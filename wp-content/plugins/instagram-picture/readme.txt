This plugin will not update your images automatically. You have to do this manually. Therefore click in the Admin menu on Instagram -> Update. After clicking on "Update images" the images are now updated. Note: This procedure eventually needs a little bit more time.

* **Are the pictures saved on my page?**
No. This plugin only saves the path to the picture in the database. The image itself will still be saved at Instagram.
